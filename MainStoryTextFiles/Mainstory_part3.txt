You wake up in the middle of the night with cold sweats.

Something isn't right, you can feel it in your gut.

You get out of your bed, still in your night suit, you walk over to the window and look out. There is a commotion downstairs.

"Its 3 in the morning", you think to yourself.
What could possibly be happening?
