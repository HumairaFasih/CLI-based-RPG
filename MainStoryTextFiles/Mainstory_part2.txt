By next morning, the campus and everything in a 5 mile radius around it has been disconnected from physical reality, and rips.
Portals have opened up to different universes from the Multiverse.
A warp has appeared where LUMS once used to be, and the bizarre disappearance of the university has become a worldwide enigma.

Everything, and everyone that was inside LUMS when the rip occurred is stuck in a bubble suspended in the Multiverse.

Someone has to bring everything back to normal.

                                           Could that someone be you?

                                   Input P to continue, Input anything else to abort
