

Dr. Sabieh Anwar is acting as a graduate advisor to two students, Hassan and Mahmood who are working on supercharged quartz crystals for their applications in energy storage.

Dr. Sabieh: So you guys have oriented the positron beam yes?

Hassan (Nods) : Yes, Doctor.

Dr. Sabieh (grabbing his coat from the hanger) : Alright, make sure the intensity is set to 20, the default is usually a lot.
We don't want to rip open a hole in the spacetime continuum now do we? (winks)

Mahmood (smiles) : Of course not Doctor, you can rest assured that we've got everything covered here!

Dr. Sabieh (nods and goes out the door) : Alright, I'll see you two in a couple of hours then. Tomorrow is an important day!

After Dr. Sabieh has left, the two graduate students make sure everything is okay, and then go out to grab some snacks themselves.
The intensity knob ofcourse, has been brought down to 20.

...........
                     
But as fate would have it, a slight, unexpected power surge causes the experiment to self abort
When the backup power comes back on, the system is automatically set to its default values.
This includes the positron intensity, which by default is set to somewhere around 26780. 

The maximum possible value. Enough to open up a naked singularity (Black Hole) in the middle of SBASSE.
