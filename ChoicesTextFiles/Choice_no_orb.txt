You realize there is nothing you can do to close the rift. You wouldn't be able to synthesize that amount of negative energy even if you wanted to.


If you had killed one of the alien creatures and taken the orb, it would have had enough negative energy to close the rift. 

But now its too late.

The core collapses and the rift is now permanent.
