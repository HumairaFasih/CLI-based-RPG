You look around in the alley for some form of defence.

There is a wooden rod lying on the floor, and you bow down and pick it up.

The creature runs at you and you swing the rod at it.

It stays still for a while, its tiny brain perhaps trying to process exactly what has happened, and then it falls to the ground.
