You decide not to get out of bed, and stay asleep. Its probably nothing and if its really something important, somebody will tell you later.
When you wake up the next day, it turns out something terrible has happened.

Apparently, a dimensional rift opened in SSE because of an experiment going haywire. 

But since you stayed asleep and nobody else volunteered to go in there and fix it, the changes are now permanent.

The rift opened a gateway for alien creatures, which invaded the campus and took control of everything, eating every living human alive.

LUMS has been doomed to stay afloat outside reality and will never return.
The world will never be able to figure out exactly what happened, but I'm sure sooner or later everyone will move on.

Don't you feel bad for being this irresponsible?
