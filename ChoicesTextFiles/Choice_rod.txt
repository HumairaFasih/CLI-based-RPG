You realize you still have the rod you took from the alleyway. So you take it out and hit the alien square in the face.

It falls to the ground with a thump, lifeless.
You're about to walk away when one of the students notices there is something on its neck.

"My joulemeter is spiking", he says "and the reading is negative..."

They both simultaneously realize what it means. Whatever is on the creature's neck is teeming with negative energy.

Its an orb of sorts. They take it off of its neck and the three of you walk up to the laboratory.

The three of you open the door by pressing the three buttons on the panels outside the laboratory.

Lo and behold, inside the room is the laser, concentrating all of its energy on the dimensional rift.

You take the orb and fling it across the room towards the laser and it stops. 
The energy seeps into the dimensional rift and seals it.
LUMS has finally returned to reality.
