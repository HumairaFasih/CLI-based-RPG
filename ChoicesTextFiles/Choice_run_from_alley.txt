Your adrenaline spikes, and you can think of nothing else but turning around and running.

And so you do just that, you turn around and run as fast as your legs can carry you. 

You can hear the creature right behind you, it has started following you.

You try to lose it but its close behind all the time.

You can feel your stamina running out.
