You're still trying to piece together exactly what is going on when you see two people approaching the crowd. 
They look... older, so they're probably not students. But they look younger than faculty members...

You're still thinking about this, when they begin to loudly address the crowd. 
The panic in their voices is quite unmistakable. But there is also some semblance of authority.
"Hello everyone, my name is Hassan Ali, and me and my colleague Mahmood quite certainly know what is happening," 

He pauses, "we think that as a result of some anomaly in our experiment we failed to foresee, a dimensional rift has opened in the middle of SSE"
There are gasps and mumbles in the crowd.

Wait.... what? You think to yourself.

"This means," his colleague, Mahmood now speaks up, "that LUMS and its surroundings have been removed from physical reality..."
Panic begins to build up in the crowd.

"But we think there's a way to fix everything if we act fast...."
Apparently the rift was caused by a sudden concentration of energy in a small region of spacetime. If the energy could somehow be cancelled, the rift could be closed.
But they need a volunteer to accompany them to the building. Apparently the whole procedure requires three people.
