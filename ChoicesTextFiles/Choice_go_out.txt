You walk downstairs and out of the hostel building. Everyone looks confused, and they're talking among themselves. You try to listen to what they're talking about.

"Sky flashed red some minutes ago...."
"Something's happened to SSE....."
"Main road leads to invisible barrier outside campus...."

You're trying to put everything together, when you hear a distant static and then somebody's voice. Someone's announcing something over a distant loud speaker. Somebody from student affairs.
They're telling everyone to not worry, as is always done when there's something to be worried about. 

Apparently some sort of maintenance is going on outside campus.

"I don't buy one word of that!", one of the people in the crowd shouts. "That's no maintenance, the whole SSE building is warped out of proportion!"

"I agree", someone else shouts, and you can already sense the panic building up in the crowd, "There are no barriers outside campus, its like we're in a bubble, its an invisible wall!"

There's some humming in the crowd, and then suddenly, someone gives out a deafening scream. Everything goes dead silent. They're pointing towards something distant.
Everyone is trying to figure out what it is. You squint your eyes to make out the distant object.

Its moving.... at an inhuman speed. Some sort of weird creature, running on all fours.

It looks at you from afar, pausing for a moment, it makes the hair at the back of your neck stand. Then it runs off and disappears into an alleyway.

At first you were a little unconvinced about all the rumors.

Nope. Something really has gone terribly wrong.
