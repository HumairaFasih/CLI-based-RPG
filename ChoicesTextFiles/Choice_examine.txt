You begin to examine the carcass to get a closer look at the strange beast, and maybe to salvage it for something important, should you need it later.

Its skin is scaly but moist, and its dead eyes are pearl white.

You notice something at the side of its neck. 
It looks like an orb of sorts and it glows faintly with a bluish hue.

You take it off of its neck and then walk back to the crowd.
