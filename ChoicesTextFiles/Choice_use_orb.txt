Neither of you can seem to figure out how you could synthesise negative energy.Then you remember something.

That orb glowing on the creature's neck, the one you took off, could it contain negative energy? 

Considering all the bizzarre things that were happening on campus, this wasn't a long shot, it was a likely possibility.

You take the orb out of your pocket and hand it to your companion.

"Will this work?"

The student eyes it for some time, then takes some sort of instrument out of his pocket and measures something from the orb.
A shine appears in his eyes.

This is it.

Apparently the creatures channeled negative energy into their glands when they travelled through the dimensional rift.

"Is it enough?", you ask him.

"It is!", he says this as he throws the orb directly at the laser. The energy seeps into the dimensional rift and seals it.

LUMS has finally returned to reality.
