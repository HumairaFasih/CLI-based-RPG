"I'll do it... I'll help"

You step up and volunteer to help the graduate students in their quest.

They look at eachother, then look at you and nod their heads in unison.

You follow them towards the building, the crowd is following close behind.

Everyone needs to know what's going to happen, but they're keeping their distance.

You can still see creatures lurking in the distance, but you try not to pay a lot of attention to them.

When you reach the outside of the main SSE building students turn around and motion the others to stop. You can see why, the building is completely warped inside, there is some strange physics going on in there.
You're beginning to have your doubts. But you decided to help them yourself. You have to stick with your decision now.

You walk over to the elevator which will take you to the floor where the laboratory is located. But your gut says something is wrong and you should take the stairs instead.
