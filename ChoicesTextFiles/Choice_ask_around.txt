You walk across the hallway to your friend's room and knock. You have to wait for some time before they open the door, still half asleep.

"Yeah what's up?", they ask you.
Clearly they're not the right person to ask. 

"Something's up, everybody's gethered downstairs, but i dont know what it is"

"I'm sure its nothing," they say, yawning, "probably some minor nuisance, you should go to sle-".


Their sentence is cut short by something that appears behind their back and grabs hold of them.

Its.... a creature. Some kind of alien creature you have never laid your eyes on before.
