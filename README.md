# The Dark Disaster - CLI-based RPG

## About 
This is a basic CLI-based Role-Playing Game (no GUI) based on a creative and exciting sci-fi scenario: a rip in the spacetime continuum due to an unexpected power issue in a physics laboratory. Everyone near the facility at the time is now trapped in a bubble in the Multiverse. <br>
Players of the game are entrusted with the responsibility of normalising reality. They are provided with choices at different stages of the game, each choice leading to a different scenario in the story, allowing players to obtain weapons and have their courage and stamina updated. 
The player wins if they consistently make the right choices.

## Learning Outcomes
- Experience with applying intermediate concepts of OOP in C++
- Extensive practice of controlling code flow with conditional branches
